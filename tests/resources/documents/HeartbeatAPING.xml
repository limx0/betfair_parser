    <operation name="heartbeat" since="1.0.0">
        <description>
            This heartbeat operation is provided to help customers have their positions managed automatically in the
            event of their API clients losing connectivity with the Betfair API.

            If a heartbeat request is not received within a prescribed time period, then Betfair will attempt to cancel
            all 'LIMIT' type bets for the given customer on the given exchange.

            There is no guarantee that this service will result in all bets being cancelled as there are a number of
            circumstances where bets are unable to be cancelled. Manual intervention is strongly advised in the event of a loss of connectivity
            to ensure that positions are correctly managed.

            If this service becomes unavailable for any reason, then your heartbeat will be unregistered automatically to avoid bets being
            inadvertently cancelled upon resumption of service.
            you should manage your position manually until the service is resumed.

            Heartbeat data may also be lost in the unlikely event of  nodes failing within the cluster, which
            may result in your position not being managed until a subsequent heartbeat request is received.

        <parameters>
            <request>
                <parameter mandatory="true" name="preferredTimeoutSeconds" type="i32">
                    <description>
                        Maximum period in seconds that may elapse (without a subsequent heartbeat request),
                        before a cancellation request is automatically submitted on your behalf.

                        Passing 0 will result in your heartbeat being unregistered (or ignored if you have no current
                        heartbeat registered).

                        You will still get an actionPerformed value returned when passing 0, so this may be used to
                        determine if any action was performed since your last heartbeat, without actually registering a new heartbeat.

                        Passing a negative value will result in an error being returned, INVALID_INPUT_DATA.

                        Any errors while registering your heartbeat will result in a error being returned, UNEXPECTED_ERROR.

                        Passing a value that is less than the minimum timeout will result in your heartbeat adopting the
                        minimum timeout.

                        Passing a value that is greater than the maximum timeout will result in your heartbeat adopting
                        the maximum timeout.

                        The minimum and maximum timeouts are subject to change, so your client should utilise the
                        returned actualTimeoutSeconds to set an appropriate frequency for your subsequent heartbeat requests.
