Betting will be suspended at the end of the race. Should there be a very close finish, a photo finish declared, a Stewards Enquiry or an Objection called the market may be re-opened with unmatched bets (again with the exception of bets for which the \"keep\" option has been selected) cancelled. The market will then be suspended when this result is announced. This market will initially be settled on a First Past the Post basis. However we will re-settle all bets should the official result at the time of the \"weigh-in\" announcement differ from any initial settlement. BETS ARE PLACED ON A NAMED HORSE.
